          <p id="projtitle">BALLA COI SIOUX</p>
          <p id="pi_testo"><br>The project consisted in making a booktrailer video to present the book <i>Balla coi Sioux</i>Â ("Dance with the Sioux") written by Luigi Grassia. We decided to do it by drawing settings, characters and atmospheres with water and ink. When you put ink in water it spreads in a very cinematic way so that we decided to use it as central technique to our video. The video took also part in a contest announced by the publishers and received a mention during the event.
          <br><br>Moreover we decided to let our video become an experience through senses, making it more accessible and enjoyable also to blind and disabled people. To do that, after a research on human senses, blindness and Native American's culture, we produced an incense box in which every smell is connected with the story of the book, Sioux rituals and the storytelling of the video.<br><br>Also worked on this project:<br> Lorenzo Ballarati, Lorenzo Becerrica and Giulia Frumento.</p>
